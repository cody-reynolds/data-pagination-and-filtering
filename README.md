# Data-Pagination-and-Filtering
This JavaScript project uses pagination and filtering techniques to display student data. 9 students are displayed on each page.

The built-in search functionality allows the user to look for names. The application accepts partial matches and dynamically filters the data to only display names containing the search text. The number of pages also adjusts based on the number of student names that have matched the search.

This project was created as part of the [Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/full-stack-javascript)
